If you would like to contribute to PyGU in any way, whether through bug 
reports, bug fixes, better code, or new code altogether, please follow these 
instructions:


1) If you are sending a large amount of code, please make a Git diff and email 
   it to me. Otherwise, go to the website given above and follow the standard 
   procedures. There is a special tab for bugs.

2) If you sent an email, just watch your inbox. If I want more information, I 
   will tell you. If I thought it was worthy, I will thank you and get you up 
   in the AUTHORS file, etc. If I didn't think it was worthwhile or that it 
   wouldn't fit in, I will thank you anyways. If you used Github, do the same 
   things, but watch the website instead.

If you use this library to do something useful, be sure to let me know! 
Sometimes a short "Good work!" message is enough to make a programmer feel 
rewarded.
